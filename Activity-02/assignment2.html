            <abbr>On April 1–2, 2025, BYU–Hawaii transformed into a hub of career exploration and international connection during the annual Asia Pacific Career Conference (APCC). Designed to prepare students for professional success in Oceania, the Asian Rim, and beyond, APCC gave students opportunities to network, learn, and present themselves to employers and graduate schools from across the globe—all right on campus.

            <cite>The conference kicked off on April 1 with an inspiring keynote address at the Polynesian Cultural Center's Hawaiian Journey Theater. On April 2, the heart of the event came alive with a vibrant Career & Graduate Fair in the Cannon Activities Center, where APCC-certified students who finished the titular Canvas course were given early access before the doors opened to all attendees. From there, students participated in career talks, professional workshops, and a networking event exclusive to certified students—all geared toward applying what they’ve learned in classrooms to real-world opportunities.</cite>

            <em>“This has gone beyond our expectations as to the number of students that are here today,” said Sister Vanessa Armstrong, a service missionary in BYU–Hawaii Career Services. “The students that registered for an APCC certification far exceeded our expectations.”

            <strong>Since its inception in 2018, APCC has drawn organizations from Asia, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the U.S. This year was no exception, with over 30 employers and graduate schools attending, including Khan Bank of Mongolia, Waikato-Tainui from New Zealand, and the Philippines Consulate General in Hawaii. But for all the impressive names, the focus remained squarely on the students.</strong>

            <sub>For many students, APCC was a pivotal opportunity to step into the professional world with confidence. Through Career Services’ professional certification course on Canvas, participants refined resumes, practiced interview skills, and built professional online profiles—preparing them to make the most of APCC’s many networking chances.

            “It’s really interesting seeing these companies, finding an internship for myself, and seeing their human resources,” said Hantian Zhang, a junior from China majoring in computer science. “It’s been wonderful for me, and I’ve been looking for something related to my major and career, like computer science or IT.”
