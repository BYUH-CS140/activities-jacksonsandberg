      <p>Zion National Park in southwestern Utah is known for its red rocks and massive canyon walls.
        I have spent many days hiking and canyoneering in Zion with friends and family. At just 1–2 hours from St. George, it
        is a must-visit for anyone in the area. The park is home to many wild animals like deer and bighorn sheep.
        The Virgin River runs through the canyon as well. You can see that in Figure 1 below.
