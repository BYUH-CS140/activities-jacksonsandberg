      <p>Snow Canyon State Park is a beautiful park just a few miles north of St. George. It's known for its red and white sandstone rock. There is also a lot of lava rock there as well as lava tubes that have created some deep caves that you can explore. Just be sure to take a headlamp with you! It's much less busy than Zion National Park and so it is a great place to enjoy a few hours with friends and family!</p>
